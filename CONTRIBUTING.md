# Contributing

The majority of contributions this project needs are going to be information on bacteria in `data/microbes.csv`. If you update a bacteria species there, please also include your sources in `data/sources.md`. A link is enough as long as maintainers are able to edit your pull request.

As far as code goes, help probably isn't needed, but if you see an issue that you'd like to fix feel free to submit a pull request. It might be a good idea to ask first just in case, so your work isn't wasted on something that won't be implemented.
