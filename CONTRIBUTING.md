# Contributing

The majority of contributions this project needs are going to be information on bacteria in `data/microbes.csv`. If you update a bacteria species there, please also include your sources in `data/sources.md`. A link is enough as long as maintainers are able to edit your pull request.

As far as code goes, help probably isn't needed, but if you see an issue that you'd like to fix feel free to submit a pull request. It might be a good idea to ask first just in case, so your work isn't wasted on something that won't be implemented.

## Species requests
Any species that's on [BacDive](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/) would be a good addition to the dataset. Please don't add duplicate species, there are some in their dataset.

Feel free to make any corrections to the current data, but unless pull requests of this sort provide a source, they won't be accepted.

## Test requests
If you see that a test is missing a result for a species and you know what it is (and have a source, of course), feel free to make a pull request with that information no matter what, but here are some tests or properties I'd really like to be in the final version if possible:

* Gram stain (from different tests is fine)
* Lactose fermentation
* Gelatinase
* Oxygen tolerance / aerobic requirements
