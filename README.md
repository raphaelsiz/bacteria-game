# Bacteria Game
This (WIP) game is based on Enchant Wordle, but you're guessing species of bacteria. For now, it's not very playable, because I haven't done enough data entry yet and I haven't told it to use very many properties of the bacteria, but the way I've coded it so far will scale.

This isn't really meant to be an open source project, but see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for information if you want to add or update species of bacteria.
