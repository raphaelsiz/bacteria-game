# What do all of these data *mean* anyway?
This game pretty much just gives you a list of results from tests these bacteria went through. But what do they mean?

Most of these tests are for very specific and seemingly irrelevant traits, like whether a species of bacteria produces a specific enzyme. But all together, they paint a detailed picture of what bacteria of that species can do and how they live. Here's a breakdown of what all of the tests mean (Well, not *all* at first. I'll be expanding as we go).

### Indole
This test determines whether the bacteria can break down tryptophan, an amino acid essential for the making of seratonin, into indole. Indole is a signalling compound in bacteria that helps them create biofilms, release toxins, and resist antibiotics (Hu et al 2010). An example of bacteria that breaks down tryptophan into indole is *E. coli*.

### Urease
This test determines whether the bacteria can break down urea with an enzyme called urease. Bacteria may use this reaction as a way of controlling their surrounding pH, or to create mineralized structures to protect their colonies--this is how kidney stones are formed, and why they're found in the urinary tract where urea is present (TODO: find source).

### Lactose

### Sucrose
